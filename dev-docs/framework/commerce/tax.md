# Tax

## Overview
Smartstore abstracts tax calculation into two parts: a *provider* resolves the tax
rate and a *calculator* applies that rate to prices. Everything is driven by
`TaxSettings` which determine whether amounts are entered and displayed
inclusive or exclusive of tax.

### Tax categories
Every product is assigned to a **tax category** so the system knows which rate
to apply. Categories are simple records with a name and display order and can be
edited in the admin area under **Configuration → Taxes**.

### Tax providers
The active provider is selected via `ITaxService` and returns a `TaxRate` for a
given `TaxRateRequest`. Smartstore ships with a fixed rate provider and a
region‑based provider in the *Smartstore.Tax* module, but you can implement your
own by registering an `ITaxProvider`.

```csharp
public class CustomTaxProvider : ITaxProvider
{
    public Task<TaxRate> GetTaxRateAsync(TaxRateRequest request)
    {
        // return 7% for books, otherwise 19%
        var rate = request.TaxCategoryId == 5 ? 7m : 19m;
        return Task.FromResult(new TaxRate(rate, request.TaxCategoryId));
    }
}
```

### Calculating tax
`ITaxCalculator` exposes helpers for products, checkout attributes, shipping and
payment fees. The calculator looks up the applicable rate, applies rounding and
returns a `Tax` structure containing both net and gross values.

```csharp
public async Task<Money> GetGrossPriceAsync(Product product, decimal netPrice)
{
    var tax = await _taxCalculator.CalculateProductTaxAsync(product, netPrice, inclusive: true);
    return _taxService.ApplyTaxFormat(tax.Price);
}
```

### Display and formatting
To append legal suffixes such as “incl. VAT” use `ITaxService.ApplyTaxFormat`
and its shipping/payment variants. Suffix visibility and whether prices include
tax are governed by `TaxSettings.DisplayTaxSuffix` and `TaxSettings.PricesIncludeTax`.

### VAT numbers and exemptions
`ITaxService` also validates EU VAT numbers and checks whether a product or
customer is tax exempt:

```csharp
var vat = await _taxService.GetVatNumberStatusAsync("DE123456789");
bool exempt = await _taxService.IsVatExemptAsync(customer);
```

### Tax settings
Injecting `TaxSettings` gives access to configuration such as the default tax
address, whether shipping or payment fees are taxable and which provider is
active.
